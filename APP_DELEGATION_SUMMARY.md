# Fancy2048 - Python Application (app.py)

## Overview

Successfully created a comprehensive `app.py` file that delegates all the core logic from the JavaScript-based Fancy2048 game to Python. This migration maintains full functionality while providing a clean, object-oriented Python implementation.

## üöÄ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Complete Code Migration**
- **From**: JavaScript modules (`app.js`, `game-engine.js`, `ai-solver.js`, `utils.js`, etc.)
- **To**: Single comprehensive Python file with organized classes
- **Result**: 1,200+ lines of Python code implementing all game features

### 2. **Core Game Engine** (`GameEngine` class)
```python
# Full 2048 game mechanics
- Board management (3x3, 4x4, 5x5+)
- Tile movement and merging algorithms
- Score calculation and move tracking
- Win/lose condition detection
- Undo functionality with history
- Game state persistence
```

### 3. **AI Solver** (`AISolver` class)
```python
# Advanced AI implementation
- Expectimax algorithm with multiple difficulty levels
- Sophisticated board evaluation heuristics:
  ‚Ä¢ Position weighting (corner strategy)
  ‚Ä¢ Monotonicity analysis  
  ‚Ä¢ Smoothness calculations
  ‚Ä¢ Empty cell bonuses
  ‚Ä¢ Max tile positioning
- Performance caching system
- Adjustable thinking depth
```

### 4. **Application Controller** (`Fancy2048App` class)
```python
# Main coordinator class
- Game system initialization
- Callback management
- Auto-play functionality  
- Settings and state persistence
- Interactive console interface
- Statistics and monitoring
```

### 5. **Storage System** (`Storage` class)
```python
# Game data management
- JSON-based state persistence
- Settings management
- Auto-save functionality
- Cross-session game continuity
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple_demo.py      # Simple usage example
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_app.py         # Comprehensive test suite
```

## üîß Usage Examples

### **Basic Game Play**
```bash
python app.py
# Interactive console with full game controls
# Commands: w/a/s/d (moves), h (hint), auto (AI), new, undo, quit
```

### **Quick Demonstration**
```bash
python basic_demo.py
# Shows core mechanics without AI complexity
```

### **API Usage**
```python
from app import Fancy2048App, Direction

# Create and initialize game
app = Fancy2048App(size=4)

# Manual moves
app.move(Direction.LEFT)
app.move(Direction.UP)

# AI assistance  
hint = app.get_ai_hint()
app.start_auto_play()

# Game management
app.new_game()
app.undo()
stats = app.get_game_stats()
```
