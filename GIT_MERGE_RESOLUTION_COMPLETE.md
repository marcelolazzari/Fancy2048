# 🎉 Git Merge Resolution Complete!

## ✅ Successfully Resolved Divergent Branches

The git pull issue has been **completely resolved** and all systems are fully operational.

## 📋 What Happened

```

   git config pull.rebase false  # Use merge instead of rebase
   ```

   ```bash
   git merge origin/main  # Completed successfully
   ```

3. **Verified All Changes Preserved:**
   - ✅ Critical fixes maintained
