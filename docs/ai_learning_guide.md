- Learning progress indicators
- Actionable improvement suggestions

## üìñ How It Works

### üé≤ Game Recording Process
```
Game Start ‚Üí Record Moves ‚Üí Analyze Outcomes ‚Üí Update Patterns ‚Üí Adapt Strategy
```

1. **Move Recording**: Each move captures:
   - Current board state (encoded efficiently)
   - Move direction and result
   - Score gained from the move
   - Board metrics (empty cells, max tile, etc.)

2. **Game Completion**: When a game ends:
   - Final score and max tile recorded
   - Win/loss status determined  
   - Move sequence analyzed for effectiveness
   - Patterns updated with success/failure rates

3. **Learning Updates**: After each game:
   - Successful patterns get increased weights
   - Failed strategies are de-emphasized
   - AI heuristics adapt to recent performance
   - Cache is cleaned to maintain performance

### üßÆ Pattern Recognition Engine

#### Board Pattern Extraction
The AI identifies key board features:
- **Corner Positions**: Tracks high-value tile placement
- **Edge Configuration**: Monitors border tile arrangements  
- **Density Distribution**: Analyzes tile value clustering
- **Empty Cell Patterns**: Records space utilization efficiency

#### Success Evaluation
Each move is scored based on:
- **Immediate Score Gain** (0-1 points)
- **Board Space Optimization** (0-1 points)  
- **Progress Toward Goal** (0-2 points)
- **Strategic Positioning** (0-1 points)

#### Weight Adaptation Formula
```javascript
new_weight = old_weight + learning_rate √ó (target_weight - old_weight)
target_weight = 0.5 + (success_rate √ó 0.5)
```

### üéØ Decision Making Process

1. **Pattern Matching**: Current board state compared to known patterns
2. **Confidence Calculation**: Based on pattern recognition accuracy
3. **Move Scoring**: Traditional heuristics combined with learned preferences
4. **Final Selection**: Best move chosen considering both approaches

## üìÅ Data Format Specification
