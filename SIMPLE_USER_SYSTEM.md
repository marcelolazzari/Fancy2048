✅ Simplified User System Implementation Complete!

🔧 Changes Made:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Backend (app.py):
✅ Removed password requirements from User class
✅ Simplified User.__init__(username) - no password parameter
✅ Removed _hash_password() and check_password() methods  
✅ Updated create_user() endpoint - only requires username
✅ Updated login() endpoint - no password validation
✅ Removed hashlib import (no longer needed)
✅ Fixed Game class reset methods to maintain username association
✅ Added has_saved_stats attribute to Game class

## Frontend (user-manager.js):
✅ Added createFormHTML() method to generate simplified forms
✅ Updated handleLogin() - no password field
✅ Updated handleRegister() - no password field  
✅ Simplified form validation (username only)

## Styling (unified_styles.css):
✅ Added comprehensive modal and form styles
✅ Added user interface styling for header and menus
✅ Added message system styling for notifications
✅ Added responsive design for mobile devices

## Validation Rules:
✅ Username required (not empty)
✅ Minimum 2 characters
✅ Maximum 20 characters
✅ No special characters validation (kept simple)
✅ Duplicate username prevention

## User Flow:
1. User visits the game → sees login modal
2. Can create account with just username
3. Can login with existing username (no password)
4. Can play as guest (temporary session)
5. All game data is saved per user automatically

## Key Benefits:
✅ Much simpler user experience
✅ No password management complexity
✅ Quick account creation
✅ Still maintains user separation
✅ Easy to use and understand

## API Endpoints (Simplified):
- POST /api/create_user  → { username: "string" }
- POST /api/login        → { username: "string" }
- POST /api/guest_login  → creates temporary user
- All other endpoints remain the same

The system is now much simpler while maintaining all the multi-user functionality!
